With my work in Physics paused indefinitely, I have entirely shifted my focus to the the tech field, strengthening my understanding of tech trends through project work and open-source contributions. My primary areas of study are backend (server) system, distributed systems with cloud integration, and asynchronous programming.

Below is a list of projects I have initiated and worked on. some are more refined or modern than others, but they all represent my effort and growth. The technologies I list are tools I've had the chance to use thoughtfully, not claim of proficiency.
