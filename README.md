I'm a physicist and Python developer with extensive experience building data analysis tools and numerical models. I've been hands-on with projects from start to finish – taking them from concept to launch.

I’ve worked on all sorts of projects, coding up models and toolboxes for scientific computing. 

Recently, I’ve been diving deep into computer vision, working on an AI-driven image classifiers and medical imaging project. It’s a field that combines my love for problem-solving and data-driven solutions.

I’m all about solving tough problems that have a real impact and love driving innovation with data. Always looking for exciting challenges to dive into!
